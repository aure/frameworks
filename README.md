# Highly Desirable Frameworks

This repository is here to support updates to the following checklist and also contains materials from a companion presentation.

This checklist can be used as a starting point to evaluate a framework's quality.  It is intended to be used by potential consumers of frameworks as well as developers of frameworks who want to make sure they've covered all the basics.

It was heavily influenced, inspired by, and cribbed from [The POSSIBLE Mobile Seaworthy Framework Checklist for Vendors](https://gist.github.com/POMBuilds/eb439cfa2300b080c7b75006ab69265e).  The biggest difference between this list and that one is that this focuses on things that are noticeable quickly when a potential user comes across a feedback.  Hence, detailed items like code quality are left to much longer discussions (and even textbooks)!

There are several sections to this document so you may want to skip ahead:

* [README](#README)
* [Sample Projects](#SampleProjects)

## README

### Use Shields/Badges from [Shields.io](https://shields.io/)

Badges along the top of the README gives an experienced reader the ability to quickly assess basic aspects of the framework.

* Tests / Build Status
* License
* Package Manager Compatibility (Carthage, Cocoapods)

### Introduce the Framework

* State the problem it solves and summarize how it solves it
* Show off a little tase of what makes it so cool

### Installation and Integration Instructions

Guide the user through the supported integration methods

* CocoaPods
* Carthage
* Swift Package Manager
* Manual

Here the developer should also provide a list of bundled third-party libraries used in the framework so that potential users can assess compatibility with other third-party frameworks.

* Credits
* License Information
